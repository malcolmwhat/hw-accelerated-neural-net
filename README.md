# hw-accelerated-neural-net
Half finished and abandoned C-implementation of a hardware accelerator algorithm for inference
in neural networks. The implementation is meant to mimic the behaviour of the hardware accelerator
presented in [2]. I started working on this during SURE 2017 and then other priorities arose. If
I'm pretty certain [this](https://github.com/malcolmwhat/hw-accelerated-neural-net/blob/master/hardware_emulator.c#L97)
is where I stopped.
